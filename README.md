This project is part of **UdacityÂ´s Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program**. Here you will find my personal solution to the challenge. The following project can be run using a Local Machine or using an external GPU (Solution provided by **Amazon Web Services** is recommended). Next, you can follow Udacitys instructions to install the necessary dependencies on a local machine or on AWS.

In this project, we train a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network** on the [Streets View House Numbers dataset ](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) (SVHND).

Follow the instructions to install the required environment and check the jupyter notebook file:

    (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook DCGAN.ipynb

### Instructions - Udacity Project

## Project Requirements
To fully test the project, you might need to install some required packages. Please start by downloading **Anaconda** using the following link: [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Once installed, clone this repository and access the downloaded folder through a **terminal** window. Next, you need to install the required packages:

Start by cloning this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/pablomateo/DeepConvGAN.git
    
Then access the downloaded folder:

    $ cd DeepConvGAN
    
Create the necessary **Conda Environment**:

    $ conda env create -f pmaienv.yml
    
Once all the packages have been installed, activate the environment:

    $ source activate pmaienv
    
Once finished, you can run my personal version of this project

     (pmaienv)$ jupyter notebook DCGAN.ipynb
